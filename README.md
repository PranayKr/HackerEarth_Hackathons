# A Predictive Analytics Project using a binary logistic regression neural network classifier 

Implemented a binary logistic regression neural network classifier to predict the probability that a member would be a loan defaulter to reduce the banks NPAs (Non Performing Assets) caused by high number of loan defaulters and hence improve the performance of the bank per financial quarter to gain back the confidence of the bankâ€™s investors.
